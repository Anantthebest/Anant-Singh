    <section id="travel-tips">
        <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
        <p>Goa is a year-round destination, but the best time to visit is between November and February when the weather is pleasant and ideal for beach activities. The monsoon season, from June to September, brings heavy rains but also lush greenery and fewer tourists.</p>
        <p>When traveling to Goa, consider renting a scooter or bike to explore the beaches and attractions at your own pace. Public transport is available but can be less convenient for tourists. Be sure to stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun while enjoying outdoor activities.</p>
        <p>Lastly, respect local customs and practices, particularly when visiting religious sites or participating in traditional festivals. Goa's laid-back atmosphere is part of its charm, so take the time to relax and enjoy the unique blend of cultures that the state has to offer.</p>
